**Mitigation Steps:**     
1)	Deploy cross-layered detection and response solutions. Find solutions that can anticipate and respond to ransomware activities, techniques, and movements before the threat culminates.
2)	Create a playbook for attack prevention and recovery. Both an incident-response (IR) playbook and IR frameworks allow organizations to plan for different attacks, including ransomware.
3)	Conduct attack simulations. Expose employees to a realistic cyberattack simulation that can help decision-makers, security personnel, and IR teams identify and prepare for potential security gaps and attacks.
4)	Scan backups for malware before you restore files. Ransomware may have infiltrated your network over a period of time, and replicated to backups before being discovered.
5)	Regularly patch products used for backup, so attackers cannot exploit any known vulnerabilities they might contain
